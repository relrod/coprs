# mod_cloudflare

This is a packaging of `mod_cloudflare` made for EPEL7.

It is a copr because there exist upstream RPMs for `mod_cloudflare` for older
RHEL versions.

This isn't a very convincing reason, and this copr could probably be turned
into an official package pretty easily. I might do this one day.
